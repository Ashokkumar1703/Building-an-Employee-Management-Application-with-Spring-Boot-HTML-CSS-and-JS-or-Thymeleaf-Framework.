1.	Employee Database Management System:

   
Project Overview:

Developed an Employee Database Management System that allows administrators to manage employee information such as personal details, department, job role, and contact information. Users can add, update, and delete employee records.

Key Features:

•	Employee Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee data, including employee ID, name, position, salary, and contact details.

•	Backend Development: Built using Spring Boot to create RESTful services for handling employee data.

•	Database Integration: Designed and implemented a MySQL database schema for storing employee details.

•	Frontend Interface: Developed a simple and intuitive web interface using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for managing employee records.

•	Authentication: Implemented basic user authentication using Spring Security.

•	Testing: Utilized JUnit for unit testing backend services and ensuring functional integrity of CRUD operations.

Search Functionality: Added search and filter options for users to quickly find employees based on name or department.

Technologies Used: Core Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, MySQL, JUnit for Unit Testing, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

Backend Development (Spring boot and JPA):

    1.Create a Spring Boot version 3.3.4 application as the backend for the website

            2.Set up JPA (Java Persistence API) for defining and managing the data model.

                        3.Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations for employee data.

                                    4.Implement validation and error handling for API endpoints.

Frontend Development(HTML,CSS and Javascript):

      1.Develop a HTML/CSS/Javascript using Thymeleaf template Enginee as the frontend for the website.

                  2.Create pages/components for adding, viewing, editing and deleting employee records.

                            3.Integrate form validation and error handling on the frontend.

Database and Data Model:

        1.Define an appropriate data model for employee information (e.g., Employee entity).

                  2.Set up a relational database using MySQL/MongoDB and configure JPA entity mappings.

Documentation:

        1.Create detailed documentation explaining how to setup, configure and run the project.

                  2.Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and data validation rules.

                            3.Use Swagger dependency
